# React Native Notes App Using react-native-paper
This is a very simple Notes App that I build while trying to learn react-native-paper a Material UI based library for React Native.

To run the app go to terminal and type `yarn start` it will open expo developer tool in browser. From there you can run it to android emulator & if your laptop and phone are connected to same network you can open it to your phone by downloading Expo Go app and scanning the QR code displayed on expo developer tool.

You can also download the apk as I have published it to expo but they retain builds only for 30 days so you may not find these builds when you see this.In that case you can email me I will put fresh builds there. Comments & suggestions are always welcomed.
